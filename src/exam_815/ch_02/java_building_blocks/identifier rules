There are only four rules to remember for legal identifiers:

   -Identifiers must begin with a letter, a $ symbol, or a _ symbol.
   -Identifiers can include numbers but not start with them.
   -Since Java 9, a single underscore _ is not allowed as an identifier.
   -You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word.
