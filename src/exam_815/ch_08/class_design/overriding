The compiler performs the following checks when you override a method:

    1. The method in the child class must have the same signature as the method in the parent class.
    2. The method in the child class must be at least as accessible as the method in the parent class.
    3. The method in the child class may not declare a checked exception that is new or broader
        than the class of any exception declared in the parent class method.
    4. If the method returns a value, it must be the same or a subtype of the method in the parent class,
        known as covariant return types.

Generics
While overriding a method with generic parameters, the signature including the generic type must match exactly.
Return values can be covariant.
