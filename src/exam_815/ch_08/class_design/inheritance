Inheritance is the process by which a subclass automatically includes any public or protected members of the class,
including primitives, objects, or methods, defined in the parent class. When one class inherits from a parent class,
all public and protected members are automatically available as part of the child class.
Package-private members are available if the child class is in the same package as the parent class.
Private members are restricted to the class they are defined in and are never available via inheritance.
