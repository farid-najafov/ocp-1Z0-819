Java will follow these rules when applying operators to data types:

1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values
   to the larger of the two types

2. If one of the values is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integral value
   to the floating-point value's data type

3. Smaller data types, namely, byte, short and char are first promoted to int anytime they are
   used with Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operand is int

4. After all promotions has occurred and the operands have the same data type,
   the resulting value will have the same data type as its promoted operands
