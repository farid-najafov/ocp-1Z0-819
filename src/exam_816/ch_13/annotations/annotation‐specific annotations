@Target
Many annotation declarations include @Target annotation, which limits the types the annotation can be applied to.
More specifically, the @Target annotation takes an array of ElementType enum values as its value() element.

Values for the @Target annotation
ElementType         Applies to
value

TYPE                Classes, interfaces, enums, annotations
FIELD               Instance and static variables, enum values
METHOD              Method declarations
PARAMETER           Constructor, method, and lambda parameters
CONSTRUCTOR         Constructor declarations
LOCAL_VARIABLE      Local variables
ANNOTATION_TYPE     Annotations
PACKAGE             Packages declared in package‐info.java
TYPE_PARAMETER      Parameterized types, generic declarations
TYPE_USE            Able to be applied anywhere there is a Java type declared or used
MODULE              Modules

@Retention
Annotations may be discarded by the compiler or at runtime. We say “may,” because we can actually specify how they are
handled using the @Retention annotation. This annotation takes a value() of the enum RetentionPolicy.

Values for the @Retention annotation
RetentionPolicy value       Description

SOURCE                  Used only in the source file, discarded by the compiler
CLASS                   Stored in the .class file but not available at runtime (default compiler behavior)
RUNTIME                 Stored in the .class file and available at runtime

@Documented
If present, then the generated Javadoc will include annotation information defined on Java types.
Because it is a marker annotation, it doesn't take any values.

@Inherited
When this annotation is applied to a class, subclasses will inherit the annotation information found in the parent class.

@Repeatable
The @Repeatable annotation is used when you want to specify an annotation more than once on a type.
Generally, you use repeatable annotations when you want to apply the same annotation with different values.

 - The repeatable annotation must be declared with @Repeatable and contain
    a value that refers to the containing type annotation.
 - The containing type annotation must include an element named value(),
    which is a primitive array of the repeatable annotation type.
